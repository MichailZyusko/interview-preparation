- Logical task
    - Find the relationship between the light bulb and the switch
        
        Q: We have two rooms that are separated by an non-transparent wall. There are 3 light bulbs in one room and 3 switches in the other. They are connected by wires, but we don't know which bulb is connected to which switch. It means that 1st bulb can be connected to 1st, 2nd or 3d switches respectively. Our task is to find the relationship between the bulb and the switch. Constraints: we are in a room with switches, we have to do some manipulations with switches and then move to another room and tell which light bulb is connected to which switch.

    - Bad pills & good pills
        
        Q: We have 5 containers with the same amount of pills and an electronic scale. There are 10 pills in each container. There are 2 types of pills: poisoned and normal. They look identical, the only difference is the weight: the poisoned one weighs 9 grams and the normal one 10 grams. Your task is to determine which container contains only the good pills? Constraints: you can only use the scales once.
